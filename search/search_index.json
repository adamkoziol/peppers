The peppers themselves have a medium heat level with a fantastic fruity flavour. Peppers ripen from a light green to white. Peppers were very susceptible to developing purple undertones due to light exposure. When fully ripe they will be completely white. Planting Information Spacing 30-60cm (12-24\u2033) between plants Location Full sun, or at least 6-8 hours of sun per day Well-drained soil Watering Water immediately after planting, then regularly throughout the season. Aim for a total of 1-2 inches per week (more when it's hotter). Notes Soil should have abundant phosphorus and calcium , so add lime and compost to the bed at least three weeks prior to transplanting Mix \u00bd cup of balanced organic fertilizer beneath each plant. Replenish throughout the season Spread mulch (such as chopped leaves or straw) around the plants to help keep the soil cool and moist. Peppers will tolerate dry soil, they will only put on good growth if kept moist. Harden off seedlings before planting Pinch back growing tips to encourage leaf production Support each pepper plant with a stake or small tomato cage, to help bear the weight of the fruit once it begins to produce.
