### Planting Information

#### Spacing 

30-60cm (12-24″) between plants

### Location

- Partial shade, or at least 4-6 hours of sun per day
- Well-drained soil

### Watering

  - Water immediately after planting, then regularly throughout the season. Aim for a total of 1-2 inches per week (more when it's hotter).

#### Notes

- **Soil should have abundant phosphorus and calcium**, so add lime and compost to the bed at least three weeks prior to transplanting
- Mix ½ cup of balanced organic fertilizer beneath each plant. 
  - Replenish throughout the season
- Spread mulch (such as chopped leaves or straw) around the plants to help keep the soil cool and moist.
- Peppers will tolerate dry soil, they will only put on good growth if kept moist.
- Harden off seedlings before planting
- Pinch back growing tips to encourage leaf production
- Support each pepper plant with a stake or small tomato cage, to help bear the weight of the fruit once it begins to produce.
