### Description

The **cubanelle** is an heirloom sweet Italian frying pepper with a sweet mild flavor. These bright green thin-walled peppers are growing in popularity and add a pretty color for frying and cooking. Chefs and home cooks often prefer them to bell peppers because of their excellent flavor and their low moisture content, which makes them perfect for quick cooking in lots of recipes. Peppers can grow to 5″ long on productive 30” plants. It is best to cut them from the stem when they are yellowish-green, but they can also be left on the plant to mature to bright red.

### Planting Information

#### Spacing 

30-60cm (12-24″) between plants

### Location

- Full sun, or at least 6-8 hours of sun per day
- Well-drained soil

### Watering

  - Water immediately after planting, then regularly throughout the season. Aim for a total of 1-2 inches per week (more when it's hotter).

### Harvesting

It is best to cut peppers from the stem when they are yellowish-green. Or wait for the fruit to ripen further turning red. The sweetness and vitamin C content go up dramatically as the fruit changes colour. If you pick green, the total numbers of peppers harvested will increase. Fruit that sets after late August will not usually develop or ripen. Pull out the entire bush just before the first frost and hang it upside down in a warm, dry place to ripen hot peppers. 

#### Notes

- **Soil should have abundant phosphorus and calcium**, so add lime and compost to the bed at least three weeks prior to transplanting
- Mix ½ cup of balanced organic fertilizer beneath each plant. 
  - Replenish throughout the season
- Spread mulch (such as chopped leaves or straw) around the plants to help keep the soil cool and moist.
- Peppers will tolerate dry soil, they will only put on good growth if kept moist.
- Harden off seedlings before planting
- Pinch back growing tips to encourage leaf production
- Support each pepper plant with a stake or small tomato cage, to help bear the weight of the fruit once it begins to produce.
