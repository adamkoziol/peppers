### Description

The **Trinidad Moruga Scorpion** is an extremely hot pepper native to the region of Moruga in Trinidad and Tobago. It currently sits as the second hottest chilli in the world after the Carolina Reaper. Although it has clocked in at 2 million SHUs at its most potent, on average the pepper are in the 1.2 million Scoville heat units range. The smallish, puckered fruits mature from green through orange and then to a deep red, at which point the flavour is most refined and fruity. This species of pepper can be grown as a perennial in warmer climates (or heated greenhouses), or brought inside over winter. 

### Planting Information

#### Spacing 

30-60cm (12-24″) between plants

### Location

- Full sun, or at least 6-8 hours of sun per day
- Well-drained soil

### Watering

  - Water immediately after planting, then regularly throughout the season. Aim for a total of 1-2 inches per week (more when it's hotter).

#### Notes

- **Soil should have abundant phosphorus and calcium**, so add lime and compost to the bed at least three weeks prior to transplanting
- Mix ½ cup of balanced organic fertilizer beneath each plant. 
  - Replenish throughout the season
- Spread mulch (such as chopped leaves or straw) around the plants to help keep the soil cool and moist.
- Peppers will tolerate dry soil, they will only put on good growth if kept moist.
- Harden off seedlings before planting
- Pinch back growing tips to encourage leaf production
- Support each pepper plant with a stake or small tomato cage, to help bear the weight of the fruit once it begins to produce.
