### Description

**Yellow Fatalii** are large, spicy, thin-walled peppers with a pleasant citrus flavor. They are the perfect hot pepper for citrus hot sauces and salsas, as well as dishes where lemon or lime is used to enhance flavor. Because the Fatalii has thin walls, drying the peppers to make a flavorful chili powder is an excellent option. Fatalii powder is perfect for adding some major heat to any dish. The Fatalii is a very spicy pepper as it ranges from 125,000 to 400,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), making it slightly hotter than the Habanero pepper, but not quite as hot at the Ghost pepper. 

### Planting Information

#### Spacing 

30-60cm (12-24″) between plants

### Location

- Full sun, or at least 6-8 hours of sun per day
- Well-drained soil

### Watering

  - Water immediately after planting, then regularly throughout the season. Aim for a total of 1-2 inches per week (more when it's hotter).

#### Notes

- **Soil should have abundant phosphorus and calcium**, so add lime and compost to the bed at least three weeks prior to transplanting
- Mix ½ cup of balanced organic fertilizer beneath each plant. 
  - Replenish throughout the season
- Spread mulch (such as chopped leaves or straw) around the plants to help keep the soil cool and moist.
- Peppers will tolerate dry soil, they will only put on good growth if kept moist.
- Harden off seedlings before planting
- Pinch back growing tips to encourage leaf production
- Support each pepper plant with a stake or small tomato cage, to help bear the weight of the fruit once it begins to produce.
