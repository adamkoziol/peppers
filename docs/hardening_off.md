## Hardening off 

---

- Depending on the weather, start exposing your seedlings to the outdoors around 3-4 weeks after they have germinated and have at least one set of leaves beyond their seed leaves (named cotyledons, are those skinny smooth leaves that come up first at germination and generally fall off after the plant has matured a bit).
- On their first day outdoors, go slow and cool. Do NOT put them out in direct sunlight on their first day out and do not put them out on a windy day. Direct sun or wind (warm or cold wind) will do them in. Ideally you would have a shady spot with diffused or indirect sunlight.
- Put the seedlings out for a short time (maybe as little as a 1/2-1hour at first) in this spot in the morning or afternoon. As long as the spot is semi-shady and the weather is still they should be fine; make sure they don't need to be watered before putting them out.
- The outdoors are harsh on these young seedlings and they need to be babied for a few days; it helps if you have a light fan blowing over the seedlings in your grow room/spot before moving them outdoors. If you don't have/want a fan you can open a door and let cool air and breeze into the growing room before you take them out. These steps are not absolutely necessary, but they help.
- Bring your seedlings back in after a short while (1/2-few hours). There is no set time here, as it depends entirely on what the weather is like that day, how far along your seedlings are, and what their inside growing conditions have been. Just check them every half-hour or so and if they are looking sad or wilted, bring them back in.
- Repeat these steps for a few days, gradually giving them more sun and more time outside.
- It usually takes about 7-10 days to get pepper plants nicely hardened off. If you do it gradually and add more sun to the hardening off area each day, they should be able to take full sun, rain and gentle winds after this.

**Important**: Hail and strong (and/or) cold winds will probably damage your plants, no matter how careful you have been in hardening them off. Be prepared to protect your plants in this case! This is why I grow in containers, bringing them inside is much easier than building shelters over them!
