### Description

**Jamaican Scotch Bonnet** plants bear fruits comparable to the Habanero pepper, but with a touch more of sweetness and spiciness. It's a favorite for Caribbean dishes. Its sweet, tropical flavor pairs perfectly well with island tastes. Plants offer big yields all season long. Peppers can be harvested at different stages. 100,000 to 350,000 SHU


### Planting Information

#### Spacing 

30-60cm (12-24″) between plants

### Location

- Full sun, or at least 6-8 hours of sun per day
- Well-drained soil

### Watering

  - Water immediately after planting, then regularly throughout the season. Aim for a total of 1-2 inches per week (more when it's hotter).

### Harvesting

When the fruit is large and firm it is ready to pick. Or wait for the fruit to ripen further turning red. The sweetness and vitamin C content go up dramatically as the fruit changes colour. If you pick green, the total numbers of peppers harvested will increase. Fruit that sets after late August will not usually develop or ripen. Pull out the entire bush just before the first frost and hang it upside down in a warm, dry place to ripen hot peppers. 

### Notes

- **Soil should have abundant phosphorus and calcium**, so add lime and compost to the bed at least three weeks prior to transplanting
- Mix ½ cup of balanced organic fertilizer beneath each plant. 
    - Replenish throughout the season
- Spread mulch around the plants to help keep the soil cool and moist.
- Peppers will tolerate dry soil, they will only put on good growth if kept moist.
- [Harden off](hardening_off.md) seedlings before planting
- [Pinch back growing tips](pinching_pepper_flowers.md) to encourage leaf production
- Support each pepper plant with a stake or small tomato cage, to help bear the weight of the fruit once it begins to produce.
