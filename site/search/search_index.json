They are the perfect hot pepper for citrus hot sauces and salsas, as well as dishes where lemon or lime is used to enhance flavor. Because the Fatalii has thin walls, drying the peppers to make a flavorful chili powder is an excellent option. Fatalii powder is perfect for adding some major heat to any dish. The Fatalii is a very spicy pepper as it ranges from 125,000 to 400,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU), making it slightly hotter than the Habanero pepper, but not quite as hot at the Ghost pepper.","title":"Description"},{"location":"yellow_fatalii/#planting-information","text":"","title":"Planting Information"},{"location":"yellow_fatalii/#spacing","text":"30-60cm (12-24\u2033) between plants","title":"Spacing"},{"location":"yellow_fatalii/#location","text":"Full sun, or at least 6-8 hours of sun per day Well-drained soil","title":"Location"},{"location":"yellow_fatalii/#watering","text":"Water immediately after planting, then regularly throughout the season.
