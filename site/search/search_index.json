On their first day outdoors, go slow and cool. Do NOT put them out in direct sunlight on their first day out and do not put them out on a windy day. Direct sun or wind (warm or cold wind) will do them in. Ideally you would have a shady spot with diffused or indirect sunlight. Put the seedlings out for a short time (maybe as little as a 1/2-1hour at first) in this spot in the morning or afternoon. As long as the spot is semi-shady and the weather is still they should be fine; make sure they don't need to be watered before putting them out. The outdoors are harsh on these young seedlings and they need to be babied for a few days; it helps if you have a light fan blowing over the seedlings in your grow room/spot before moving them outdoors. If you don't have/want a fan you can open a door and let cool air and breeze into the growing room before you take them out. These steps are not absolutely necessary, but they help. Bring your seedlings back in after a short while (1/2-few hours). There is no set time here, as it depends entirely on what the weather is like that day, how far along your seedlings are, and what their inside growing conditions have been. Just check them every half-hour or so and if they are looking sad or wilted, bring them back in. Repeat these steps for a few days, gradually giving them more sun and more time outside. It usually takes about 7-10 days to get pepper plants nicely hardened off. If you do it gradually and add more sun to the hardening off area each day, they should be able to take full sun, rain and gentle winds after this. Important : Hail and strong (and/or) cold winds will probably damage your plants, no matter how careful you have been in hardening them off. Be prepared to protect your plants in this case!

To pinch pepper flowers, simply use your fingers or small pruners to gently remove the first round of flower buds that the plant produces \u2013 especially when the plant is still small (about 8 inches tall or less). I do this for small chili peppers and larger bell peppers alike. You can remove all the earliest flower buds, or only some of them. Either way, it will help the pepper plant grow.

This dark foliage plant quickly loads up with hundreds of pods that go through numerous transitions before finally maturing pink peach. They look pretty cute, but they do pack a punch, quite a bit of heat and oil in these pods. Planting Information Location Full sun, or at least 6-8 hours of sun per day Well-drained soil Soil preparation Soil should have abundant phosphorus and calcium , so add lime and compost to the bed at least three weeks prior to transplanting Timing Transplant peppers outside in spring after the last risk of frost has passed Ensure that overnight temperatures are consistently over 10\u00b0C before planting Harden off seedlings before planting Spacing 30-60cm (12-24\u2033) between plants Planting Dig a hole larger than the root ball of your pepper. Ensure that it is deep enough, so that when the pepper is planted, the soil is level with the transplant's cotyledon leaves (the lowest set of leaves) Mix \u00bd cup of balanced organic fertilizer or compost into the hole Gently remove the pepper from its container and loosen the soil and roots Place into the hole and fill the soil in around the plant Gently pack down the soil and add more if needed Water immediately after planting Spread mulch around the plants to help keep the soil cool and moist. Support each pepper plant with a stake or small tomato cage, to help bear the weight of the fruit once it begins to produce. Watering Water regularly throughout the season. Aim for a total of 1-2 inches per week (more when it's hotter). Peppers will tolerate dry soil, they will only put on good growth if kept moist. Harvesting When the fruit is large and firm it is ready to pick. Or wait for the fruit to ripen further brown. The sweetness and vitamin C content go up dramatically as the fruit changes colour. If you pick green, the total numbers of peppers harvested will increase. Fruit that sets after late August will not usually develop or ripen. Pull out the entire bush just before the first frost and hang it upside down in a warm, dry place to ripen hot peppers. Care Pinch back growing tips and optionally top the plants to encourage leaf production In case of unexpected frost, water, then cover plant with a frost cloth or a deep layer of mulch Replenish fertilizer or compost throughout the season Don't over-fertilize your pepper plants with Nitrogen, especially later in the season, as too much nitrogen will result in a bushy plant without blossoms or fruit.

Although it has clocked in at 2 million SHUs at its most potent, on average the pepper are in the 1.2 million Scoville heat units range. The smallish, puckered fruits mature from green through orange and then to a deep red, at which point the flavour is most refined and fruity. This species of pepper can be grown as a perennial in warmer climates (or heated greenhouses), or brought inside over winter.","title":"Description"},{"location":"trinidad_moruga_scorpion/#planting-information","text":"","title":"Planting Information"},{"location":"trinidad_moruga_scorpion/#location","text":"Full sun, or at least 6-8 hours of sun per day Well-drained soil","title":"Location"},{"location":"trinidad_moruga_scorpion/#soil-preparation","text":"Soil should have abundant phosphorus and calcium , so add lime and compost to the bed at least three weeks prior to transplanting","title":"Soil preparation"},{"location":"trinidad_moruga_scorpion/#timing","text":"Transplant peppers outside in spring after the last risk of frost has passed Ensure that overnight temperatures are consistently over 10\u00b0C before planting Harden off seedlings before planting","title":"Timing"},{"location":"trinidad_moruga_scorpion/#spacing","text":"30-60cm (12-24\u2033) between plants","title":"Spacing"},{"location":"trinidad_moruga_scorpion/#planting","text":"Dig a hole larger than the root ball of your pepper.
